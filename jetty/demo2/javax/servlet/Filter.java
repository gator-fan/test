	/** 
	* A filter is an object that performs filtering tasks on either the request to a resource (a servlet or static content), or on the response from a resource, or both.
        * <br><br>
	* Filters perform filtering in the <code>doFilter</code> method. Every Filter has access to 
	** a FilterConfig object from which it can obtain its initialization parameters, a
	** reference to the ServletContext which it can use, for example, to load resources
	** needed for filtering tasks.
	** <p>
	** Filters are configured in the deployment descriptor of a web application
	** <p>
	** Examples that have been identified for this design are<br>
	** 1) Authentication Filters <br>
	** 2) Logging and Auditing Filters <br>
	** 3) Image conversion Filters <br>
    	** 4) Data compression Filters <br>
	** 5) Encryption Filters <br>
	** 6) Tokenizing Filters <br>
	** 7) Filters that trigger resource access events <br>
	** 8) XSL/T filters <br>
	** 9) Mime-type chain Filter <br>
